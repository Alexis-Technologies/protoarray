description: Apply the Alexis JavaScript style (Metarhia-derived, linted by oxlint and formatted by oxfmt). Use when writing or editing .js, .mjs, .ts files (with certain corrections for typescript), formatting code, or when the user asks about code style or linting.

<!-- Adapted from metaskills v1.0.5 (skills/js-conventions) for the Alexis toolchain:
     oxlint + oxfmt instead of ESLint + Prettier, pnpm instead of npm, 100 columns instead of 80. -->

# JavaScript Code Style

Use following conventions for JavaScript and TypeScript code.

## Preparations

- Linting is oxlint (`.oxlintrc.json`) and formatting is oxfmt (`.oxfmtrc.json`, `.editorconfig`);
  never add ESLint or Prettier
- The package manager is pnpm; the scripts are already in package.json:
  - `pnpm lint`: oxlint over the source, test, script and bench directories
  - `pnpm format`: oxfmt rewrites those files in place
  - `pnpm format:check`: oxfmt check only, as CI runs it
- Before and after code analysis with AI run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test`
- Use `pnpm format` to fix formatting; fix lint errors in the code, and suppress a rule only for an
  intentional construct with a targeted `// oxlint-disable-next-line <rule>`

## Formatting

- Use single quotes and semicolons
- Keep max line length 100 (ignore URLs)
- Use trailing commas in multiline arrays, objects, and params
- Keep one empty line between semantic blocks
- Follow oxfmt and `.editorconfig` for spacing, braces, and indentation (2 spaces, LF)

## Modules

- Use CommonJS: `require` and `module.exports`, no `import`/`export` in `.js` sources
- Do not add `'use strict'`
- Use the `node:` prefix for Node.js built-in modules (`require('node:fs')`)
- Always include the `.js` extension in relative requires (`require('./schema.js')`)

## Naming

- Use `camelCase` for variables and parameters
- Use `UpperCamelCase` for classes and types
- Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
- Use `new` with capitalized constructor names
- Use `error` in catch blocks, not `err`
- Use short names (`e`, `i`) only in short one-line callbacks
- Use descriptive names in multiline callbacks (`event`, `index`, `item`)
- Use boolean prefixes: `is`, `has`, `can`, `should`
- Use singular names for entities and plural names for collections
- Use verb names for functions and handlers (`parse`, `create`, `handle`, `on`)
- Include units in numeric names (`timeoutMs`, `sizeBytes`) except options

## Best practices

- Prefer `const`, minimize `let`, never use `var`
- Prefer arrow functions (except prototype/class methods)
- Do not mutate input parameters; avoid `arguments`
- Keep functions small and single-purpose
- Decompose long expressions into intermediate variables
- Prefer explicit loops (`for`, `for..of`) in hot paths
- Use array methods when they improve readability
- Use `===` and `!==` only
- Keep return types consistent
- Avoid nested ternaries and deep callback nesting
- Self-documented and self-descriptive code: do not add
  obvious comments, code should be clear without comments
- Use iteration methods like `.map`, `.filter`, `.reduce` if it is good for code semantic
- Try to avoid `.forEach` if callback operates with outer context

## Optimizations

- Keep object shapes stable: same keys, types, and key order
- Change shape only in constructors and creational patterns; avoid mix-ins
- Use shape mutations only for metaprogramming
- Use `null` for empty reference types; use `undefined` for empty primitives
- Avoid array destructuring in assignments and loops; object destructuring is ok
- Keep hot functions monomorphic: stable arg count, types, and return types
- Avoid reading the same property from many unrelated object shapes
- Prefer string or number literals for status/codes; avoid mixing primitives with objects in one variable
- Keep objects that share a property to the same shape; avoid polymorphic hotspots
- Prefer fixed property access (`obj.x`) over dynamic keys (`obj[key]`)
- Keep arrays dense, avoid holes and mixed element kinds
- Initialize object fields in constructor/factory once and in one order
- Set field to `null` or `undefined`; avoid `delete`
- Move reusable callbacks outside loops
- Keep `try/catch`, spread/rest away from hot loops
- Use `Map` for dynamic key dictionaries, plain objects for fixed schemas
- Use `Set` for big and dynamic collections, prefer arrays for short and stable
- Use `Object.create(null)` for pure dictionaries
- Use typed arrays for numeric and binary workloads
- Reduce GC pressure: reuse arrays, objects, and buffers when safe
